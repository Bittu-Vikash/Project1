<h1 align="center">🚢 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the Titanic Dataset</h1>

---

<h2>📘 Overview</h2>

This is my first data analysis project.  
In this project, I have conducted an in-depth analysis of **Survival of passengers onboard the Titanic** using **Python** and its libraries.  
The goal was to determine the relationship between passenger characteristics and survival outcomes.

<h2>📂 Dataset</h2>

**Source:** Titanic Dataset from Seaborn  
**Rows:** 891  
**Columns:** 15  

**Column Names:**  
- **survived:** Contains information about who survived and who did not.  
  `0 = Did not survive`, `1 = Survived`  
- **pclass (class):** Passenger class in numbers (1, 2, 3) and text form (First, Second, Third).  
- **sex:** Passenger gender.  
- **fare:** Passenger fare information.  
- **other columns:** `age`, `embarked`, `sibsp`, `parch`, `embark_town`, etc.

<h2>🧩 Analysis Steps</h2>

1. **Data Loading** – Import dataset using Seaborn.  
2. **Data Cleaning** – Handle missing values.  
3. **Univariate Analysis** – Distribution of features like age, embarking port, sex, and class.  
4. **Bivariate Analysis** – Relationships between survival and other features.  
5. **Statistical Testing** – Conducted *t-test* for fare differences between genders.  
6. **Multivariate Analysis** – Created correlation heatmap.  
7. **Key Insights** – Summarized patterns influencing survival.

<h2>🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used</h2>

- Python  
- Pandas  
- Seaborn  
- Matplotlib  
- NumPy  
- SciPy

<h2>📊 Summary</h2>

- Women and children had higher survival rates.  
- Higher-class passengers had better chances of survival.  
- Fare correlated positively with survival probability.  
- Most passengers onboard were British, as most boarded the ship at **Southampton (S)**, England.

<h2>⚓ Fun Facts About the RMS Titanic</h2>

- The **RMS Titanic** was the largest ship afloat in 1912, measuring **269 meters (882 feet)** long.  
- It sank on **April 14, 1912**, after hitting an iceberg on its maiden voyage from Southampton to New York.  
- Only **38%** of the 2,224 passengers and crew survived.  
- The “**women and children first**” protocol was strictly followed, leading to survival differences by class and gender.  
- The wreck was discovered in **1985**, lying about **3,800 meters (12,500 feet)** deep in the North Atlantic Ocean.
